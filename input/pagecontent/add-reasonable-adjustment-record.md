### Overview

Patient consent must be obtained before recording any adjustment.  See [Consent to Share Information](consent-to-share-information.html) for details.

Key purposes of the Reasonable Adjustment Flag include: 

* identifying a patient may require services to be adjusted  
* identifying when patients with specific impairments present for care (learning impairments, behavioural impairments or any other impairment in line with the disability protected characteristic of the [Equality Act (2010)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance)). 
* ensuring the key information is shared consistently across health and care â€“ wherever the patient is treated. 
* ensuring that the information is clearly visible in clinical systems 

### Usecase

After obtaining consent from a patient, an adjustment flag may be created.  A condition may also optionally be recorded.  If an adjustment flag exists, there must be an additional flag created, designated as the master flag, to indicate that there are reasonable adjustments recorded for the patient.

### Workflow

A practitioner performs an examination and determines that a condition and/or an adjustment should be recorded.  If the patient does not consent, no details are recorded.  If the patient consents, then the adjustment is recorded, and optionally the condition as well.

</div>

### System Interactions

The practioner decides to record a condition with the patients consent.  This could be done with individual calls to the required endpoints, or can be done in a single transaction Bundle.  A transaction Bundle can help with data integrity requirements and also help to reduce required http calls.

### Examples

* [Patient example](Patient-PatientExample1.html)

The following set of examples constitute the individual associated resources with the intial addition of a flag for Reasonable Adjustment.  This includes the Consent resource where the patient has agreed to share information.  Also a master Flag resource, the adjustment Flag resource and the associated Condition resource.  All resources have contained provenances.

A transaction Bundle is also given that allows these resources (plus the patient) to be entered in an atomic traction.  It uses PUTs, where in the case of an intial update, it may be done as a [conditional update](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#cond-update)

* [Consent](Consent-ConsentExample1.html)
* [Master flag](Flag-RAMasterFlagExample1.html)
* [Adjustment flag 1](Flag-RAFlagExample1.html)
* [Condition 1](Condition-ConditionExample1.html)
* [Transaction Bundle 1](Bundle-AddConditionTransactionExample1.html)

The following set of examples are for the same patient, and constitute an addition flag and condition.  The transaction Bundle here illustates an idempotent update by simply adding the new resources to the first transaction Bundle.
