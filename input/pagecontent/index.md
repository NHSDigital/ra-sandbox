### Introduction

The FHIR® Reasonable Adjustments API has been developed by NHS England. The API aims to better support the delivery of care by opening up nationally stored information and data about Reasonable Adjustments that patients want to share with healthcare professionals.

The vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

### Programme Mission

NHS England, in partnership with patient and carer groups and other key stakeholders are working to develop a national reasonable adjustment flag which will be available to organisations providing direct care to the patient. The flag will be visible from when the patient is referred, registers for care or presents in an emergency.  

It will also eventually be available to screening services. It can indicate the patient’s key impairments (as defined in the Equality Act 2010) across areas including learning, mobility, mental health, social or behavioural to make receiving organisations understand that the patient should be considered for adjustments to care. The flag can also indicate key potential reasonable adjustments such as the need for accessible information, carer involvement, priority appointments or other adjustments to care.
